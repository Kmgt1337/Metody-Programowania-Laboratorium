You might ask, 'Should we fear joining the Dominion?' And I answer you, 'Not in the least. 
We should embrace the opportunity.' The Dominion recognizes us for what we are: the true leaders of the Alpha Quadrant. 
And now that we are joined together, equal partners in all endeavors, the only people with anything to fear will be our enemies. 
My oldest son's birthday is in five days. To him, and to Cardassians everywhere, I make the following pledge: by the time his birthday dawns, there will not be a single Klingon alive inside Cardassian territory, or a single Maquis colony left within our borders. 
Cardassia will be made whole. All that we have lost will be ours again. And anyone who stands in our way will be destroyed. 
This I vow with my life's blood. For my son... for all our sons.
